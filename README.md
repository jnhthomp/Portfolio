This website serves as a page for recruiters, hiring managers, or potential clients to view in order to learn about me, contact me, and see my experience/prior work. It was created with React and designed and created by myself from the ground up.

This application was bootstrapped with create-react-app. Styling is done with CSS modules. I do like styled-components as an alternative to CSS modules. However, I prefer to keep my CSS and JS separate unless I am incorporating something particularly dynamic where the JS and CSS interaction is necessary or more convenient.

### How to install/use
1. ```$npm install```
2. ```$npm start```

For deployment information see: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment

## Optimizations
- Consider switching to Vite to bundle/run the application instead of create-react-app
- Consider a way to have alternative themes that the user can select
  - Although this would be 'possible' with CSS modules it would likely require importing multiple CSS modules and selecting which one to use based on a state within the app. This sounds terribly inefficient compared to styled-components which can simply dynamically select a color and can use React context to access the current theme details.
- Fade in content on the screen instead of an instant load, may look a little nicer.
## Lessons Learned
- Creating dynamic layouts/content that looks good on all screens
- Using colors, type, and spacing to create visually appealing web applications
- Utilizing CSS animations to create more interesting web content
